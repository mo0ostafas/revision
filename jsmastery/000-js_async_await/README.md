# :globe_with_meridians: Countries Currencies :money_with_wings:
This is the first project on [JavaScript Mastery Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery) it was about async await feature in JS (ECMAScript 2017 version).

The idea of the project is to make 2 functions depend on async await with axios and api for countries and currencies.

## :ballot_box_with_check: App Core Features
The app has 2 main functions:
- `getCountries`: get country/ies by passing currency as a parameter
- `convertCurrency`: converts amounts (default: 1) of a currency to another currency

## :hammer_and_wrench: Used Tools & Techs

- put your API keys in the file `.env.example`.
- rename file from `.env.example` to only `.env`.
