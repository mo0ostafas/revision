# :star: SEO
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of improving a website’s visibility on search engines (e.g. Google & Bing).


## :question: Why to learn SEO?
As a web developer, learning SEO is essential to attract more free traffic (more cost-effective than paid ads). Making your website rank higher in search results when users search for relevant topics leads to user trust. SEO also improves site speed, mobile-friendliness, and usability.


## :rocket: How to improve SEO?
There are many methods to improve SEO can be under the following categories:

### HTML & RWD:
- Title: Use a unique and descriptive title for each page.
- Metadata: Provide structured metadata to help search engines understand the page:
  - Charset: Set character encoding to `UTF-8` for better compatibility.
  - Describtion: Write a compelling meta description with keywords.
  - Keywords: Use relevant keywords but avoid keyword stuffing.
  - Viewport: Ensure responsive design and scalling.
  - Canonical URL: Prevent duplicate content issues.
  - Author: Specify the content creator or organization.
  - Favicon: Add a recognizable favicon (appears as tab, bookmarks and shortcut icons) for branding and user experience.
- Semantic HTML: Use meaningful HTML tags (provided at `HTML5`)
- Attributes: Use `title`, `alt`, and `aria` attributes for links, images, and accessibility.
- Mobile-Friendly: Ensure the website adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

### Performance:
- URL Structure: Use short, descriptive, and keyword-rich URLs.
- Core Web Vitals: Improve Google’s user experience metrics:
  - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): Optimize images and server response time for fast loading.
  - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): Ensure visual stability by specifying image and ad sizes.
  - FID (First Input Delay): Minimize JavaScript execution time for better interactivity.
- Performance Optimization: Compress images, use lazy loading, and minify HTML/CSS/JS files.

### Another Ways:
- Schema Markup: Use structured data to enhance search engine understanding and rich snippets.
- `sitemap.xml`: Provide a roadmap of your site to help search engines crawl it efficiently.
- `robots.txt`: Control which pages search engines can or cannot crawl and index.
- Web Vitals: Monitor and optimize key user experience metrics.
- Social Media Signals: Improve rankings through social engagement and sharing.

- For Frameworks/Apps: Optimize JavaScript-heavy websites for search engines.
  - Pre-Rendering: Generate static pages in advance for better indexing.
  - Dynamic Rendering: Serve search engines a different version optimized for crawling.

#### CSR :vs: SSR
CSR (Client-Side Rendering) and SSR (Server-Side Rendering) are two different approaches for rendering web pages, and they significantly impact SEO.
- CSR: Renders content in the browser, requiring extra SEO optimizations.
- SSR: Renders content on the server for faster indexing and better SEO.
